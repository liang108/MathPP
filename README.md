# Math++
A personal project dedicated to implementing some math concepts. Currently implemented, with some unit tests, are:

* Vectors
* Matrices
* Complex Numbers

I did not use the C++ `std::vector` class to practice with dynamic memory issues.
I got the idea for this project from a book titled "Guide to Scientific Computing with C++" by Pitt-Francis and Whiteley. Although the book contains solutions to these problems, I have yet to check my implementation with them.
